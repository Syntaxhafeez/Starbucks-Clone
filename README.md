# â˜• Starbucks Clone

A simple clone of the original Starbucks website, created to demonstrate my web development skills. This project mirrors the design of the Starbucks website, focusing on the aesthetics and layout that make the brand so recognizable.

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end replica of the Starbucks coffee shop website, built using HTML and CSS. By recreating this site, I aimed to hone my skills in web design and development, paying attention to detail and the use of modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styled the website to closely match the original Starbucks website, including custom icons.

## How to Use

1. **View Code**: You can view the code and related images in the repository.
2. **Copy & Paste**:
   - Create an `index.html` file and paste the HTML code.
   - Create a `style.css` file for the CSS code.
3. **Run Locally**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the clone in action.
